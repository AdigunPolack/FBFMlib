Ladies and gentlemen and all DOS-game enthusiasts everywhere, a SPLENDID hello to you all, and welcome to my brand-new sound-library created exclusively in FreeBASIC DOS that is fully dedicated to the OPL2 sound chip and all of its nine (9) sound channels that can let you be in full charge of making your own sfx/music, all in the background.  Henceforth, I bring you <b>FBFMlib</b>, aka <i>FreeBASIC FM-Synth Library</i>.
<br></br>
Right now, this original sound-creation library is VERY early in development as the functions included on there are quite rudimentary so far... but as I go deeper into this lib in MS-DOS/FreeDOS, things are sure to improve soon, I am certain.  But, whatever is there should suit you fine for now to get you started on creating/adding your own music/sfx in FreeBASIC, and that sample source code of “<b>FBFM_v02.bas</b>” should show you how to do it real easy now, I promise you!  💕

I closely tested this lib using SBEMU on real hardware, and also using a Yamaha-XG YMF724 PCI Sound Card on another computer of mine called the HP Thin Client T5710, as well as under emulation using <a href="https://dosbox-staging.github.io/">DOSBox Staging</a> v0.81.0... and they all worked brilliantly as a few examples!!  However, it did not work under the OPL3LPT device for some strange reason... 🤔️
<br><br>
However, on most any Sound Blaster or compatible sound card that has built-in OPL2 support at the very least, it should work, I gotta say, so you should be good to go!!!  😎
<br><br>
Anyhow, do enjoy my very special start of my makings of an all-new OPL2-themed music/sfx creation library in FreeBASIC DOS, as there has not even been a dedicated OPL2 sound-creation library in FB indeed on MS-DOS/FreeDOS, ever... <i>UNTIL NOW</i>, that is!!! 🎶️😊💖️👍🏿️
